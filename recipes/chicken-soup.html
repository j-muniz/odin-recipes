  <h1>Chicken Soup</h1>
  <img src="../img/soup.jpeg">
  <h3>Soup for all!!</h3>
  <p>Delicious soup can be as simple or as complicated as you want. You can throw in anything but the kitchen sink, or just a few items. The choice is yours. Experimentation is greatly encouraged; just word of caution; it is easier to add salt than to make something less salty.</p>
  <p>Feel free to add any ingredients not listed or to omit what is. adjust amounts depending on the size of the pot used and the ammount of people you are intending to feed. The ingredients will be more than enough to feed a family of four.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>4 chicken thighs</li>
    <li>3 large white onions</li>
    <li>carrots</li>
    <li>potatoes</li>
    <li>olives</li>
    <li>fresh green beans</li>
    <li>any and every vegetable you want to toss in</li>
    <li>chicken or vegetable broth or powders (for extra flavor)</li>
    <li>2 packets of sazon (gives a nice redish color)</li>
    <li>whatever herbs you have around and are in the mood for</li>
    <li>salt to taste</li>
    <li>any additional spices you like to use</li>
    
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>fill a pot about halfway with water</li>
    <li>place chicken fully submerged into pot and begin chopping veggies</li>
    <li>after about 15min of boiling the chicken there will be some foamy substance floating. use a small mesh strainer to remove as much as you can.</li>
    <li>when you do not see anymore foam forming begin adding your vegetables and spices</li>
    <li>after chicken has been cooking for 30-40min remove a thigh from the pot and place into a bowl</li>
    <li>use 2 forks and begin pulling and shred the meat from the bone (the meat will easily tear and shred into tinny pieces when it is cooked through)</li>
    <li>put the meat back into the pot and repeat until all chicken is shredded and deboned</li>
    <li>soup will be done or almost done at this point, either serve and enjoy or if you would like it to be thicker add mash potato flakes to your desired thickness of broth and let it simmer for 10 more min to give it time to mingle into the soup</li>
    
  </ol>
