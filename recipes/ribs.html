  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Ribs</li>
    <li>olive oil</li>
    <li>dry rub of choice</li>
    <li>bbq sauce</li>
    <li>apple cider vinegar</li>
    
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>clean ribs and cut away as much fat as possible and remove that membrane (optional) </li>
    <li>drizzle some olive oil onto the ribs</li>
    <li>generously coat and rub in the dry rub (let it sit for 15min or so, optional)</li>
    <li>place the metal rack known as a trivet into the instant pot</li>
    <li>pour a little bit of water and the vinegar to about a quarter-half of the legs of the rack</li>
    <li>place ribs in and cook for about 30min on high pressure</li>
    <li>let the meat naturally decompress (you could seize the meat making it tougher)</li>
    <li>place it onto a backing pan and brush on your choice of bbq sauce</li>
    <li>place into oven set to broil for 5-10min to let the bbq sauce caramelize</li>
    <li>remove to let it rest and enjoy a super tender fall off the bone rack of ribs</li>
  </ol>
