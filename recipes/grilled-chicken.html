  <h2>Perfect golden chicken wings</h2>
  <p>I might have a more hands on approach when it comes to grilling, but it sure is worth it when you get to bite down on perfectly golden brown crispy wings seasoned to perfection. Give it a try! </p>
  <p>It all started on a cool autumn afternoon back in 1995. The leaves were falling from the trees and blowing in the wind. My father would often cook on the grill. The aroma would fill the air and make my young tummy rumble with anticipation. This is when I knew I would forever be  entranced from these wonderful smells coming from that hot box of fire that I was to not touch or go near....(Three pages later)... alas I will at last divulge you some of my preferred spices and cooking method for this classic and simple meal. </p>
